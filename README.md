# Gapminder Data Analysis

In this project it is going to be analyzed the data associated with [Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/), an independent Swedish foundation that fights devastating misconceptions about global development. In particular, itÂ´s goal isto find trends among countries that have significantly improved their educational level in recent years and how this improvement relates to wealth, population density, CO2 emissions associated to fossil fuels and human development index.

# Data

The data to be used are the following:

- **Mean years of school until 25-34 years old**
Average number of years of school attended by all people in the age and gender group specified, including primary, secondary and tertiary education.

- **GDP/person**
Gross Domestic Product per person adjusted for differences in purchasing power (in international dollars, fixed 2011 PPP based on 2011 ICP).

- **Population density**
Average number of people on each square km of land in the given country.

- **CO2 emissions/person**
Carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of fossil fuels (Metric tonnes of C02 per person).

- **Human development index**
Human Development Index is an index used to rank countries by level of "human development". It contains three dimensions: health level, educational level and living standard.

# Analysis
The analysis has been done in two Jupyter Notebooks that can be downloaded from the following links:
